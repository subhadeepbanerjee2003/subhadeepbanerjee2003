1. `display:flexbox `:- on the parent makes all div siblings reside in the same line

2. we know two div elements can't be in the same line `but if we use display:flexbox on the parent div it will make all div siblings reside in the same line`

3. we can use `justify-content` proparty/attribute to control the position of the elements/siblings in the parent div
   
a) `justify-content: flex-start` :- will make the elements start from the left side of the parent div.it is the `default value`
b) `justify-content: flex-end` :- will make the elements start from the right side of the parent div
c) `justify-content: center` :- will make the elements start from the center of the parent div
d) `justify-content: space-between` :- will make the elements start from the left side of the parent div and the last element will be on the right side of the parent div
e) `justify-content: space-around` :- will make the elements start from the left side of the parent div and the last element will be on the right side of the parent div and the space between the elements will be equal
f) `justify-content: space-evenly` :- will make the elements start from the left side of the parent div and the last element will be on the right side of the parent div and the space between the elements will be equal and the space between the first element and the left side of the parent div and the last element and the right side of the parent div will be equal
