`notes from first cohort class`

1. <div> takes up all the space available horizontally
   
2. <span> only takes up as much space as needed
   
3. we know two div elements can't be in the same line `but if we use display:flexbox on the parent div it will make all div siblings reside in the same line`
   
4. <center> centers text but not used anymore
