// Rust is an ahead-of-time compiled language, meaning you can compile a program and give the executable to someone else, and they can run it even without having Rust installed

// cargo is the Rust package manager to initialize Rust projects without having to manage the project layout manually and install all the dependencies at once
// rustfmt is the Rust code formatter
